# Mail-Swipe | Keep your real mailbox clean and secure. 

Mail Swipe is a python script that helps you to create temporary email addresses and receive emails at that address. It uses the API provided by [1secmail](https://www.1secmail.com/api/) to create emails addresses and fetch emails.

You can either generate your own email address or you can generate a random email address using this script. Once you receive an email it will be save in a text file inside the **"All Mails"** folder.

***For security reason you cannot read messages from addresses: abuse@domain, webmaster@domain, contact@domain, postmaster@domain, hostmaster@domain, admin@domain. All other addresses are free to use.*** - 1secmail team -
